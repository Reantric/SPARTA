# SPARTA

Website/app to help visualise and understand the most resource efficient way to address vulnerabilities relating to spaceflight.

## Description

* Has a GUI for finding the minimum set/utility of Secure-by-Design technical specifications to address a complete set of common
weakness enumerations. 
* Utilizes a weighted set-cover algorithm to efficiently solve and approximate the problem, ensuring optimal or near-optimal solutions ($\Omega(\log n)$ approximation ratio).
